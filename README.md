Website based Lanyon theme using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). It's
based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler and the
version of Scott Chamberlains webpage https://github.com/sckott/scott.


- to generate the references list from R cran run
  `knitr::knit(knitr::spin('publications.R',  knit = FALSE));
  unlink('publications.Rmd')` (ugly but we need to delete the Rmd file
  because interpreted as md file by Lanyon)

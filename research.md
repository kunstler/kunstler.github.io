My research is at the interface between **plant community ecology, functional traits and biogeography**. I am interested in assessing how the **demographic** response to **biotic interactions** and **climate** of tree species with different functional traits values can explain the diversity of traits observed within a community and the large scale patterns of vegetation structure observed along climatic **gradients**. This would help to understand how climate change affect the structure of forest ecosystems.

My main research lines are:

1. Linking tree demography, population dynamics and traits
2. Drivers of species coexistence
3. Interplay of biotic interactions and climate stress effect on plant dyanmics
3. Individual-based models of forest dynamics
